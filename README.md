# Lateral_inhibition_DLL3
This is matlab code for lateral inhibition model with delta-like ligand 3 (Kim, Ko, and Sage, 2022). 
The program is adapted from Lateral Inhibition Tutorial (2014) by Formosa-Jordan and Sprinzak 
(for more details please see Formosa-Jordan, P., Sprinzak, D. Modeling Notch signaling: a practical tutorial. 
Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1187:285-310. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-1139-4_22).
The Matlab files include:
- Transcis_Multicell_DLL3.m : The code simulates lateral inhibition with DLL3 on hexagonal two dimensional cell lacttices. Outputs are shown as time traces of cells and as a movie of the simulation.
- Paramsearch_DLL3_Hminmax.m : The code simulates lateral inhibition with DLL3 on hexgonal two dimensional cell lattices across a two dimensional parameter space. Outputs are shown as as a phase diagram for different values of the parameters.
